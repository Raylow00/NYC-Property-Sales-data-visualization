Data Visualization on Kaggle dataset New York City Property Sales

A beginner's data visualization practice using Kaggle dataset on New York City Property Sales. Personally, I love New York City, but the property price in the city is pretty high, but it could give me some insights if I could visualize what the characteristics are when it comes to high property sales.

What I learnt:
- Basic data visualization techniques such as bar chart, scatter plot, boxplot etc.
- Basic data preprocessing techniques such as scaling, one-hot encoding etc
- Basic model fitting using Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Random Forest etc
